After a somewhat quiet period, we're back with new projects and ideas. We've acquired some new hardware - MikroTik gateways

The first out of ten underwent its shakedown today, and we achieved decent results.

We are still scouting for potential locations to deploy the rest of gateways.


Super eager to see where this will lead us.
